ðŸš€ My First React App with Sass ðŸŽ¨

I built this one-page app purely for learning purposes, diving into the world of React and Sass for the first time. Using Sass allowed me to experiment with variables, mixins, and styles in a clean and efficient way.

This simple app showcases the power of React for dynamic state handling and Sass for smooth, maintainable styling. Itâ€™s just the beginning, but it's already a blast to build and explore! ðŸ’¥
